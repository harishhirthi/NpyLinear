# NpyLinear
Numpy based implementation of Linear Neural Network for classification task.

## Description:
Implementing the linear layer of neural network from scratch using only numpy along with different activations, initializers for classification task. 

This has been created as development package. To use this

1. Clone repository
```
git clone https://github.com/harishhirthi/NpyLinear.git
cd NpyLinear
```
2. Build from source (Note: It requires python version >= 3.9. Make sure of it.)
```
pip install -e .
```

## Dataset:
[MNIST](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/overview)

## Instructions:
1. [Sample.ipynb](Sample.ipynb) provided within the repository gives the glimpse of usage of npyLinear. (Note: Download train.csv from [here](#dataset) and rename as per name of the csv in notebook and scripts.)
2. It is also provided with model, train and testing script.
